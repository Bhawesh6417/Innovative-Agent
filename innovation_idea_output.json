For example:\n\n* What specific tasks or decisions do doctors currently struggle with during surgery that you'd like the AI tool to assist with?\n* Are there any specific medical procedures or specialties you'd like to focus on (e.g. neurosurgery, orthopedic, cardiothoracic)?\n* Would this tool be used during routine surgeries or more complex, high-risk procedures?\n* Are there any existing tools or systems that you think your AI tool could improve upon or integrate with?\n\nAlso, what kind of data do you envision the AI tool using to make informed decisions during surgery? For example:\n\n* Medical images (e.g. X-rays, MRI, CT scans)?\n* Patient medical history and records?\n* Real-time data from sensors or monitoring equipment?\n* Other types of data?\n\nThe more information you can provide, the better I can assist you in developing a comprehensive innovation proposal.",

    "solutionSummary": "Neurosurgical tumors are a complex and challenging area of surgery. To help you develop a comprehensive innovation proposal, I'd like to ask some follow-up questions to better understand your idea.\n\n1. Who is the target audience for your AI tool? Is it primarily neurosurgeons, or could it also be used by neurologists, radiologists, or other medical professionals involved in the diagnosis and treatment of neurosurgical tumors?\n2. Can you elaborate on the specific challenges you'd like the AI tool to address during neurosurgical tumor removal procedures? For example, are you looking to improve:\n\t* Tumor identification and localization?\n\t* Surgical planning and simulation?\n\t* Intraoperative decision-making and guidance?\n\t* Post-operative patient monitoring and follow-up?\n3. Are there any specific types of neurosurgical tumors you'd like the AI tool to focus on, such as:\n\t* Brain tumors (e.g. gliomas, meningiomas)?\n\t* Spinal tumors (e.g. spinal cord tumors, vertebral tumors)?\n\t* Tumors of the skull base or cranial nerves?\n4. How do you envision the AI tool interacting with the surgical team? Will it be used as a standalone system, or will it integrate with existing surgical navigation systems or imaging modalities (e.g. MRI, CT, PET)?\n5. What specific technologies do you think would be most relevant for developing this AI tool? For example:\n\t* Deep learning architectures for image analysis?\n\t* Natural language processing for processing medical text data?\n\t* Computer vision for analyzing medical images?\n\t* Sensor integration for real-time data collection?\n6. Are there any specific proposal details you'd like to focus on, such as:\n\t* Market size and growth potential for neurosurgical tumor removal tools?\n\t* Competitive landscape and existing solutions in the space?\n\t* Regulatory requirements and potential pathways for FDA approval?\n\t* Potential partnerships or collaborations with medical institutions, hospitals, or research organizations?\n\nBy answering these questions, we can start to develop a more comprehensive understanding of your innovation proposal and identify key areas to focus on in terms of technology, market, and regulatory strategy.",
